      <p>Including post-treatment variables can drastically impact the results of experiments. The data for this example was simulated so we know that, on average, the pest-control caused plants to grow 1.52 inches taller than they would have grown without the pest-control. We can see that the analysis without the post-treatment variable <code>bugs</code> is very close to the true treatment effect. The analysis that includes the post-treatment variable <code>bugs</code> is far off from the true treatment effect and would lead an incorrect assessment of the non-toxic environmentally friendly pest-control!</p>

      <p>To demonstrate how adjusting for post-treatment variables introduces bias, consider another hypothetical example: does an exercise program increase muscle strength? The treatment variable <code>z</code> records whether or not an individual participated in the exercise program, the pre-treatment variable. Mid-way through the study, weekly trips to the gym was recorded for each individual with the post-treatment variable <code>gym</code>. </p>

      <p>Post-treatment variables, like <code>gym</code>, have different <a href="">potential outcomes</a> that depend on the treatment variable. This is the primary problem of controlling for post-treatment variables. The table below shows the <a href="">potential outcomes</a> and observed outcomes of <code>gym</code> for 2 individuals from our exercise study.In real contexts, we would not have access to both <a href="">potential outcomes</a> but we can imagine them for the purposes of this example. Notice that two individuals differ in <code>z</code> but have the same value for <code>gym</code> despite haviving different <a href="">potential outcomes</a>. Controlling for <code>gym</code> is not a fair comparison of <code>strength</code> because we are not accounting for how <code>z</code> changes the value of <code>gym</code>. This is not a problem for pre-treatment varibales becuase thier value can not be changed or influenced by <code>z</code>. </p>

        <p>Because we have access to our potential outcomes time-machine, we can also plot each runner's unobserved (counterfactual) outcomes.
