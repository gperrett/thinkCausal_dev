# Contributing to thinkCausal

This outlines how to contribute to thinkCausal and applies to both programmatic and educational content changes. thinkCausal heavily uses [bartCause](https://github.com/vdorie/bartCause) and [plotBart](https://github.com/joemarlo/plotBart). Please consider contributing to those packages if you have specific model or plotting changes.

## Issues
Issues and questions can be submitted through the [Github Issues page](https://github.com/gperrett/thinkCausal_dev/issues).

## Code guidelines

thinkCausal is a mix of 'base' R and tidyverse code. We try to adhere to the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for code formatting. The easiest way to to format ~90% of your R code is `Code -> Reformat Code` within Rstudio.

We heavily use [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) for documenting functions and [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) for unit testing. Please familiarize yourself with both and feel free to reach out with an [issue](https://github.com/gperrett/thinkCausal_dev/issues) if you have any questions.

## Pull request

Contributions should be made via the [pull request process](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). We recommend [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) thinkCausal, creating a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches), making your changes/additions, and then submitting the PR. Please include a description of the changes and the 'why' within the PR. See [here](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) for more information about forking and branching.

Feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/gperrett/thinkCausal_dev/issues) if you're uncomfortable with the PR process and only have a small or isolated change.
