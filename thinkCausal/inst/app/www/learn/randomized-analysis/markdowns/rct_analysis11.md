#### Comparing methods

When we compare the estimated ATE from difference in means, regression and BART to the true ATE, we see that the estimates from each method are very close the true ATE! 

Since the estimates from each method are so close to one another and so close to the true ATE, how should we decide which method to use in practice? 

Recall that in real research problems we can never calculate the true ATE, we can only estimate the ATE. When we estimate a treatment effect we always have uncertanty. Confidence or credible intervals are used to summarise the uncertaty around estimations of treatment effects. Methods that carry more uncertantly are less efficent than methods with less uncertanty. 

For randomized experements, difference in means, regression and BART are all unbiased but there are differences in efficency between each of these models.
