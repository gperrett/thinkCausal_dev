#### Balance and Overlap

Randomization ensures that, **on average**, all covaraites are balanced and have complete overlap. This is true regardless if we measure variables or not.  

In our study, we can see `age` is balanced between runners in the treatment and control groups. We also see there is complete overlap for `age` between the treatment and control conditions. 

Imagine another potentially important variable `weight`. In our study we did not measure `weight`, but because the treatment has been randomly assigned, we can expect that weight is balanced and has complete overlap between the treatment and control groups.
