#### Calculating the true ATE

As we learned in the estimands learning module, when we have all potential outcomes we can calculate the true average treatment effect (ATE) by taking the average of each runners individual causal effect. 

As we can see, the true ATE for our study on HyperShoes is -5.4. A runner who wore HyperShoes ran 5.4 minutes faster, on average, than they would have ran had they worn standard shoes. 

Remember that we can only calculate the true ATE when we have access to all potential outcomes which a researcher can never have in practice!
