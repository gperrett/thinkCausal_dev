#### Comparing Efficiency

When we compare the residuals across difference in means, regression and BART we see that the residual from the BART model are smaller compared to difference in means and regression. Smaller residuals means a model is providing a better fit to the data which reduces uncertainty in our estimated treatment effect and creates more efficient estimates.
