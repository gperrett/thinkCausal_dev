#### BART

When the treatment is randomly assigned, fitting a BART model with all measured covariates will provide an unbiased estimate of the true ATE! When we use BART to analyze the data from our study the estimated ATE is -5.4.

Like regression our BART model allows us to incorporate information about `age` but without assuming any linear relationships.
