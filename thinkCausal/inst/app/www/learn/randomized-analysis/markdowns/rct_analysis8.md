#### Difference in Means 

When the treatment is randomly assigned, taking the difference in the mean of the treatment group and the mean of the control group is an unbiased estimate of the true ATE! If we compare the difference in means from out data, the estimated ATE is -5.6. 

The difference in means does not use any information about runners age to inform the estimate of the ATE.
