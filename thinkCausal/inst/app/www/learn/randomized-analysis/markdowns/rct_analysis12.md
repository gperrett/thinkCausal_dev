#### Efficency: difference in mean 

We can see that the difference in means method provides a weak fit to the data. While the fit is unbiased, resdiduals for each point (shown in black) are high. When covariates like `age` are associated with the outcome variable Y (running times), difference in means will be less efficent compared to methods that account for variation explained by covariates.
