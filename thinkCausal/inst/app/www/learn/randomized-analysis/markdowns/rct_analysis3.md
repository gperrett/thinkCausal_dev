#### Individual Causal Effects (ICE)
When we have access to all potential outcomes, we can calculate the individual causal effect for each runner. For more details about how individual causal effects are calculated you can refer to the potential outcomes learning module!

We can zoom-in on 3 runners from our study and see they have individual causal effects of -6.2, -2.5 and -8.4.
