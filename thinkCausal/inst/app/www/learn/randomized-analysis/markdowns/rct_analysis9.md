#### Regression

When the treatment is randomly assigned, fitting a regression with covaraites in also an unbiased estimate of the true ATE! If we fit a regression to the data from our study you can see the estimated ATE is -5.6. 

Our regression model differs from the difference in means model by incorporating information from the treatment variable and our single covariate `age`, however, `age` can only be incorporated as a linear relationship.  

*Note that while our regression model includes `age` as a predictor, we cannot make causal claims about `age`*.
