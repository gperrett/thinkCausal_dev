#### Efficiency: BART

BART models do not have the same linearity constraints as regression, as we can see the BART model is the best fit to our data and has the smallest residual. This leads to the most efficient estimation of the treatment effect!

Like regression, BART will only improve efficiency if the included covariates explain variation in the outcome variable Y (running times).
