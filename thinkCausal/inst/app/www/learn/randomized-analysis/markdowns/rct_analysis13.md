#### Efficiency: regression

When using regression information about `age` is incorporated into the estimation process, however, this information can only be incorporated in a linear form. Even though using linear information about `age` is not a perfect fit to our data, the residuals are less than they were when using difference in means. 

Regression will only increase efficiency if the covariates in the regression model explain variation in outcome variable Y (running times). If `age` was unrelated to outcome variable Y (running times) then regression would be equally efficient to using the difference in means method.
