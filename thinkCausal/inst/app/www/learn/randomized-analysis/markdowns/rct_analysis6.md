#### Estimating the ATE in Randomized Studies

In practice researchers only have access to factual outcomes. Now our data reflects the type of analyses we actually conduct in practice. In real studies, we can never calculate the true ATE, but *we can estimate the ATE*.

**When the treatment is randomly assigned, taking the difference in means, fitting a regression with covariates and fitting a BART model with covariates all produce unbiased estimates of the true ATE!**
