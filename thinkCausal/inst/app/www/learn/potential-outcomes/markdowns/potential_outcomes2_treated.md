You decided that Alex should wear the Hypershoe! Alex ran the marathon and finished with a time of 3.1 hours. Is this faster than the finishing time Alex would have had if Alex did not wear the shoes?  We don't know! Therefore, we still donâ€™t know whether the shoes caused Alex to run faster, run the same speed or run slower than without the HyperShoe.

But what if we could go back in time and make a different choice?
