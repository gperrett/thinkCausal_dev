## Fundamental problem of causal inference

You may have noticed a major problem in this story, how can we compare the factual and counterfactual outcomes if the counterfactual outcome did not actually happen? This is the fundamental problem of causal inference. We can never observe both potential outcomes for Alex or for any individual. How can we proceed if we can never observe both potential outcomes? 

For now, we’re asking you to suspend belief and imagine we have access to a potential outcomes time machine. In the case of Alex, we would record Alex’s running time with HyperShoes (the factual state) and then use our potential outcomes time machine to go back in time to the point where Alex received HyperShoes, at this point we would switch Alex’s treatment assignment to wearing standard shoes (the counterfactual outcome). Alex would run the race and we would record Alex’s finishing time with standard shoes (the counterfactual outcome). 

Instead of using an impossible time machine to see how fast Alex would have run without HyperShoes, why can’t we simply have Alex re-run the race a week later wearing standard shoes? The problem is that many things besides the HyperShoes would be different one week later. First, Alex would be tired from the first race, how would we know if it was the shoes that caused a different time or tiredness? Other external events like different weather conditions could also make it impossible to know if any difference in times was caused by the shoe or some other influence. 

The only difference between factual and counterfactual potential outcomes is the treatment, all other variables need to be exactly the same. For now we will use our potential outcomes time-machine to observe all potential outcomes, in later modules we will return to more practical (and possible!) ways of dealing with the fundamental problem of causal inference. 


## Potential outcomes table

Alex was not the only one that could have worn HyperShoes or standard shoes. We can imagine a study with many runners that either wore HyperShoes or standard running shoes. Each runner has their own set of potential outcomes and the individual causal effect of HyperShoes is unique across different runners:
