You decided that Alex should wear the normal running shoes! Alex ran the marathon and finished with a time of 3.2 hours. Is this slower than the finishing time Alex would have had if Alex wore the HyperShoe?  We don't know! Therefore, we still donâ€™t know whether the HyperShoe could cause Alex to run faster, run the same speed or run slower than normal shoes.

But what if we could go back in time and make a different choice?
