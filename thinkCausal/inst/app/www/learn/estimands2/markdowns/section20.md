### Potential Outcomes: ATE

Lets put all of our data into a potential outcomes table. This will help us clarify the ATE.

For the runners that wore HyperShoes (Z = 1), we can observe `Y1` values but are missing the `Y0` values. 

For the runners that did not wear HyperShoes (Z = 0), we can observe `Y0` values but are missing the `Y1` values. 

To estimate the ATE, we need to fill in the missing `Y0` values for runners that wore HyperShoes and the missing `Y1` values for runners that did not wear HyperShoes.
