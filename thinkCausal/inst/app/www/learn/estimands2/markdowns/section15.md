### We just dont know...

Without any data-points to represent counterfatuals, the three possible stories we imagined are all equally plausible. 

Lack of data-points to represent counterfatuals is called *lack of complete overlap*. 

In this example, we have complete overlap those that wore HyperShoes (red), but lack complete overlap for those that did not wear HyperShoes (blue).

Because we lack overlap for large sections of the control group so we can't estimate the ATC in reliable way.
