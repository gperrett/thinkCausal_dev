### The Marathon Data
Looking at the data from the marathon, `qualifying time` is clearly a confounder. Runners with faster qualifying times are more likely to wear HyperShoes and faster qualifying times are very predictive of finishing times in the race! 

In fact, only runners with the fastest qualifying times wore HyperShoes! There appear to be no runners with qualifying times greater than about 145 minutes that wore HyperShoes. As we'll see, this will impact our choice of an average treatment effect. We'll begin by exploring the Average treatment effect of the treated (ATT).
