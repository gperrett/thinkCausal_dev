We have a problem! Like the ATC, there is no overlap of the control group among higher values of `qualifying time` and without overlap we have no way of estimating counterfactuals for slower runners in the control group. 

In observational studies, the ATE is the most difficult average causal effect to estimate because you need complete overlap for both the treated group and the control group. 

In this example, because we did not have overlap for the ATC we will not have overlap for the ATE.
