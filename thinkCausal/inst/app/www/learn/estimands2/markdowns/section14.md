It's just as likely that hyperShoes may only work for fast runners and actually cause slower runners to run even slower! 

It's possible that hyperShoes require high levels of fitness to use properly. For fast runners, who are very fit, this is not a problem but slower runners are less fit and cannot use the hyperShoe as intended causing them to run even slower.
