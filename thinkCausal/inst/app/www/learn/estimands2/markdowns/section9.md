### Potential Outcomes: ATC
If we took all the points from the last figure and put them in a potential outcomes table, we'd see that the ATC has the opposite problem of the ATT. 

For the ATC, we can observe every runners value of `Y0`, but we are missing every single value of `Y1`.

To represent our missing `Y1` values, lets try to use the technique we did last time. This time we will use information from the treatment group to serve as conterfatuals for the control group.
