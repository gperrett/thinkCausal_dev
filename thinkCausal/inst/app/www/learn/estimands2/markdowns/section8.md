### The ATC

The ATC is the average causal effect of HyperShoes for the runners that did not wear HyperShoes. The ATC is a confusing concept. 

When estimating the ATC, our goal is to understand whether or not the runners that did not wear HyperShoe would have ran faster if they had worn HyperShoes. 

Each blue point represents a runners that did not wear HyperShoes. We are only interested in comparing the blue points to what would have happened if each of those blue points had worn HyperShoes.
