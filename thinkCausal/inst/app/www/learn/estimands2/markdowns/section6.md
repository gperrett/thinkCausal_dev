### Filling in missing Y0 values

We can use a statistical model like Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) or linear regression to fill in our missing `Y0` values. 

Here we'll use BART, the statistical model used in the thinkCausal analyses. The red line represents our best estimate of what would have happened to each runner in the treatment group had they not worn HyperShoes! If you'd like to learn more about how statistical models are used to predict counterfactuals, check out the module on the fundamental problem of causal inference.
