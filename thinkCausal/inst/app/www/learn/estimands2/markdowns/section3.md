### Potential Outcomes: ATT

Thinking about the ATT in terms of potential outcomes, we can observe every runners `Y1` because all of these runners are in the treated group. However, we are missing every runners `Y0`! 

Our problem is we need a way to consider what would have happened to this group of runners if they had not worn HyperShoes. 

How can we proceed?
