We could just as easily imagine a situation where hyperShoes work even better for slower runners than they do for fast runners! 

Maybe the hyperShoe works by improving running technique and the fastest runners already have mastered their technique so they get a smaller benefit from hyperShoes compared to slower runners that have much more room for improvement.
