### Partial Overlap

It is possible that you may only have partial overlap like the data shown here. 

Here we have overlap for both treated and control runners for the middle region of `qualifying times` but there is no overlap for treated runners with low `qualifying times` and there is no overlap for control runners with high `qualifying times`. 

Here is an example where there is not overlap for the ATE, ATT or ATC! 

There are no control runners with low `qualifying times` and no treated runners with high `qualifying times`. 

How should we proceed when we have not overlap at all?
