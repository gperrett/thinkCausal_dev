# Choosing an estimand with overlap

When there is complete overlap for either the treated group or the control group, overlap can help inform your choice of a causal estimand. To understand more about the connection between overlap and choosing an estimand in observational studies we'll use a variation on our running example of the causal effect of HyperShoes on running times:

Imagine a team of researchers attended a large marathon.  As each runner crossed the finish line they recorded whether that runner wore HyperShoes or standard shoes as well as the runner's finishing time. To participate in the marathon, each runner was required to run in a qualifying race, this race took place before HyperShoes were available to any runners. The variable `qualifying time` represents each runner's time from the qualification race. For the sake of this example we'll imagine that `qualifying time` is the only confounder.
