# Balance 

We prefer randomizing the treatment whenever possible because we can expect the treatment and control groups to be balanced across all covariates. When the treatment is not randomly assigned, which happens alot, we need to lean on statistical models to adjust for imbalances between the treatment and control group. But what does it mean for a covariate to be balanced or imbalanced? 

A covariate is balanced if it has the same distribution in both the treatment and control group and imbalanced (not balanced) if it is distributed differently in the control group than it is in the treatment group. 


How do we know if the distribution of a variable is the same between the treatment and control groups? When looking at a single variable we can compare the mean, variance and skew between the treatment and control groups.
