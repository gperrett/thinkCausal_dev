### Analysis without post-treatment variables

When `bugs` **is not included** in the analysis, the causal effect of the new fertilizer is estimated by comparing the average pounds of tomatoes from plants that received fertilizer (colored in red) against the average pounds of tomatoes from plants that did not receive the new fertilizer (colored in blue).

The results of this analysis, which does not control for post-treatment variables, found that receiving fertilizer caused plants to produce an average of **1.51 more pounds of fruit**, than they would have produced had they not received the new fertilizer.
