When `bugs` **is not included** in the analysis, the causal effect of `pest_control` is a comparison between the average height of plants that received the pest-control (colored in red) against the average height and plants that did not receive the pest-control(colored in blue). 

Plants that received the pest-control grew an average of **1.595 inches taller**, than they would have grown had they not received the pest-control.
