As you just saw, including post-treatment variables can drastically impact the results of both randomized experiments and observational studies. 

If we had access to all potential outcomes we could see that the true average treatment effect is -.18. In this example knowing all potential outcomes would mean that we could see how many pounds of tomatoes would have grown if all of the farmers 400 plants had the new fertilizer and how many pounds of tomatoes would have grown if none of the farmers 400 plants had the new fertilizer. In practice we never know both potential outcomes for every unit in our studies.
