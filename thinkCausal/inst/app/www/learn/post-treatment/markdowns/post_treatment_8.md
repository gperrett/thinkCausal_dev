## Recap

Including post-treatment variables as predictors in a causal analysis should be avoided. As we saw in the bugs example, including post-treatment variables can distort causal analyses and lead you to incorrect conclusions. Post-treatment variables are any variables that occurred after the treatment was assigned and could possibly be influenced by the treatment. Statistical models with post-treatment variables make unfair comparisons and are biased because models do not have access to the potential outcomes of those variables.
