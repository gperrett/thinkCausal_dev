When the farmer included the post-treatment variable `bugs`, the estimated average treatment effect was -.18 with a 95% confidence interval between -.42 and 0.06. This is far off from the true average treatment effect 1.58. This analysis, is not only far from the true average treatment effect but would lead the farmer to reach the incorrect conclusion about the new fertilizer!

Some fields would describe `bugs` as a *mediator*, *process variable* or *intermediate outcome* meaning that the treatment appears to work by protecting plants from being eaten by bugs. *Mediator*, *process variable*, *intermediate outcome* are all post-treatment variables and should not be adjusted for.
