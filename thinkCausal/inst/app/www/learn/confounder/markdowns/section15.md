`professional status` is **confounder**. A **confounder** or a **confounding variable** is any pre-treatment variable that is *both* related to the treatment and related the outcome. When we do not account for a confounder, the average observed outcomes from the treatment group will be an unreliable representation of what would have happened to the control group had they worn hyperShoes and vice versa. The analysis reported by the company did not adjust for this confounder so the estimated ATE of of -42.17 is misleading! **If we properly account for all confounding variables in our analysis, we can still estimate unbiased causal effects for observation study!**
