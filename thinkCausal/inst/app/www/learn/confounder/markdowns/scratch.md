<!--- If the ignorability assumption $Y1, Y0 \perp Z$ is true, then on average, there are no baseline differences between runners who wore hyperShoes (the treatment group) and runners who did not wear hyperShoes (the control group).

This means that, on average, runners who wore hyperShoes and runners who did not wear hyperShoes would have equal: 

- Professional vs Amateur
- age
- fitness
- income
- number of dogs!
- any variable you can imagine!!
<br>
When the treatment variable is the only difference that can account for differences in the running time with hyperShoes $(Y1)$ and the the running time without hyperShoes $(Y0)$, we can use the average observed outcomes from one group to represent the average counter-factual outcomes of the other.
