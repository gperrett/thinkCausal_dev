Observational studies, where the treatment is not randomly assigned, make a strong **ignorability assumption**. For observational studies, the ignorability assumption is that we have measured all confounders and have accounted for every confounder when estimating a causal effect. If this assumption is not satisfied and there are confounders not included in the analysis the result will be biased. 

To understand the ignorability assumption for observational studies and the role of confounders we will use our running hyperShoe example:

Imagine the company that makes hyperShoes released a new study that found wearing hyperShoes causes runners to run a marathon an average of 42.17 minutes faster than what that they would have finished without wearing hyperShoes! 

This study compared the marathon times of 300 runners that wore hyperShoes against the marathon times of 724 runners that did not wear hyperShoes. An Average Treatment Effect(ATE) of -42.17 minutes seems like an unbelievably large effect for simply changing shoes. We'll investigate to see if we should really believe that a pair of hyperShoes would cause us to run over 40 minutes faster!
