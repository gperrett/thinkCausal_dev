When we condition to `professional status` and `USA`, we will fill in the missing counter-factuals with the observed times of runners who are the same on all counfounders. 
<br>
<br>
After filling in the missing counter-factuals we can take the difference between the average time with hyperShoes (`Y1`) and the average time without hyperShoes (`Y0`). 
<br>
<br>
For professional runners from the Unites States, the estimated treatment effect of hyperShoes is -11.31.
