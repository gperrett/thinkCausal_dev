The problem is that in observational studies, the treatment variable is not randomly assigned. Without random assignment the treatment and control group can look very different from one another. If these differences are related to the outcome (running time) then the treatment and control group will poorly represent one another! **This study is an observational study where hyperShoes were not randomly assigned.** Runners were not randomly assigned to wear hyperShoes, but self selected into wearing or not wearing hyperShoes.
