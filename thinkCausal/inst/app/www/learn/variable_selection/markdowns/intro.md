# Variable Selection 

For causal inference problems, the recommended approach to variable selection is to **include any pre-treatment covariate that could be predictive of the outcome variable**. 

You may have heard that including many variable in a single analysis is problematic because of co-linearity between variables or overfitting the model. In causal inference problems, co-linearity is not a problem to worry about. 

When you are using thinkCausal for a causal analysis, you do not need to worry about overfitting because algorithm used by thinkCausal automatically prevents overfitting. 

In these two learning modules you can learn about what co-linearity and overfitting are and why they are not  reasons to exclude variables from a causal analysis.
