## Suspending beleif

Again, before moving on to estimating the ATT, we'll suspend belief and imagine that we have access to all potential outcomes. We can see each runners finishing time for if they had worn HyperShoes and if they had worn standard shoes. We can see the highly non-linear relationship between age and running times along with the individual causal effects (ICE) of all runners we need to calculate the ATT (shown in black lines). Remember that because we are interested in the ATT, we are only need the counter-factuals of runners in the treatment group.
