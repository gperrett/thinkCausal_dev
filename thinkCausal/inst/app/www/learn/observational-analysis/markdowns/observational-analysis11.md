## Suspending beleif: access to all potential outcomes

Again, before moving on to estimating the ATT, we'll suspend beleif and imagine that we have access to all potential outcomes. We can see each runners finishing time for if they had worn HyperShoes and if they had worn standard shoes. Because we are interested in the ATT, we are only need the counterfactuals of runners in the treatment group.  

We can see the highly non-linear relationship between age and running times along with the individual causal effects (ICE) of all runners we need to calculate the ATT. Remember that, in practice, we never have access to all potential outcomes and can never make this calculation.
