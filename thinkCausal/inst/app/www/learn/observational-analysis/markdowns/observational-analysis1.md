Designing studies with a randomly assigned treatment is the most effective way to obtain unbiased estimates of a true causal effect. Under random assignment, we can expect that the treatment and control groups are balanced (in expectation) and that there is complete overlap (in expectation) across treatment groups for all variables. Crucially, **this is true for both measured and unmeasured variables**! 

While random assignment is always preferable from a statistical perspective, there are many situations where it is impossible or unethical to randomly assign a treatment. In observational studies, where participants self-select into the treatment or control conditions (there is no random assignment), we can sometimes use statistical models to estimate causal effects while accounting for imbalance by predicting counterfactual values . 

Let's consider a hypothetical example where you were given data from a recent running race with 200 runners. Some of the runners wore the newly developed HyperShoes, while some of the runners wore standard shoes. The treatment (wearing HyperShoes) was not randomly assigned, runners choose for themselves which shoes to use. Besides the treatment variable Z (HyperShoes or standard shoes) and outcome variable Y(running times), the dataset has measurements of age. How can we determine if wearing HyperShoes caused runners to run faster than they would have run had they worn standard shoes?
