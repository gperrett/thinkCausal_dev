## Comparing statistical models: linear data

Lets compare the results from our 3 statistical models. 

Difference in means is far off from the true ATT, and the uncertanty estimates provided by difference in means do not cover the true ATT. 

When the assumption of linearity and the assumption that all confounders are measured and included in the model are held, linear regression can estimate the true ATT even when treatment is not randomly assigned. 

Likewise, when all all confounders are measured and included in the model estimates from a BART model are unbiased estimates of the true ATT.
