## Regression with all confounders 

When the data is linear and all confounders are included, estimates from a linear regression model are unbiased! Our linear regression adjusts accounts for the imbalance of `age` between the treatment and control groups and estimates the ATT is -5. 

In this example linear regression is a great solution to the challenges posed by observational studies but as we'll see later, estimates from linear regression will only be unbiased when the assumptions of a linear relationship between covariates and the outcome variable and the assumption that all confounders have been measured and are included in the linear regression are met.
