## Suspending beleif: calculating the true ATT

When we suspend our beleif and have access to all potential outcomes, we can calculate the true ATT of our sample by taking the average of all the individual causal effects for runners who recived the treatment (wore HyperShoes) in the real world.

We can see that the true ATT from our sample is -4.9, this is the true ATT that we will be attempting to estimate. Remeber that in practice, we will never actually know the true ATT!

Now we will return to reality where we only have access to our observed data and need to estimate the ATT.
