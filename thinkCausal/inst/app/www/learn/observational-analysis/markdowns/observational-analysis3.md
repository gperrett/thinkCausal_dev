### Imbalance

In observational studies, the treatment is not randomly assigned and we no longer expect covariates to be balanced between the treatment and control group.  So it's not surprising in this study that on average, runners in the treatment group are about 14 years younger than the runners in the control group. 


We will need to rely on a statistical model to correct this imbalance or else the substantial difference in age will bias our estimate of the ATT.
