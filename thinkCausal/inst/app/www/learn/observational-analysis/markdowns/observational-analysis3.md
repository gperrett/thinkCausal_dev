## Checking balance

In observational studies the treatment is not randomized and we no longer expect balance in covaraites between the treatment and control group. When we calculate the balance for our our observational data, we see that *runners in the treatment group are about 14 year younger on average than runners in the control group*. As we will see. without adjusting for this imbalance, the sustantial difference in age will bias our estimate of the ATT.
