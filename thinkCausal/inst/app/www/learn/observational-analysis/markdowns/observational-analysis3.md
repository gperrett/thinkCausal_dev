## Imbalance

Runners in the treatment group are an average of about 14 years than runners in the control group. In observational studies, the treatment is not randomly assigned and we no longer expect covariates to be balanced between the treatment and control group. 


We will need to rely on a statistical model to correct this imbalance or else the substantial difference in age will bias our estimate of the ATT.
