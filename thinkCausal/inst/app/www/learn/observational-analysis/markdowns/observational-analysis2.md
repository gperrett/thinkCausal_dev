### Our observed data

When we plot the data from our observational study, we can see that `age` is related to the treatment assignment (whether or not a runner wore HyperShoes) and `age` is also related to the outcome (Y running times). Variables like `age` that are associated with both the treatment and the outcome variables are called confounders. As we will soon see, when confounders are not appropriately accounted for, estimated treatment effects can be biased.
