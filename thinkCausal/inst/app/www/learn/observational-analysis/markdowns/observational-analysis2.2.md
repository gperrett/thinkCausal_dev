### Choosing an Estimand

In this example, we'll be estimating the effect of the treatment on the treated, or ATT. It appears that every runner under 35 wore HyperShoes. Without runners older than 35 in the treatment group, we don't have enough available information to infer about counterfactuals for the average treatment effect (ATE) or the effect of the treatment on the controls (ATC) but we do have complete overlap for the ATT and we have enough information to infer about what would have happened if those participants had not worn HyperShoes! 

In a completely randomized experiment (where everyone has the same probability of receiving the treatment) the ATE, ATT and ATC are expected to be the same because there are no systematic differences between the treatment and control groups. So whether we average individual level treatment effects over the treatment group or the control group or the whole sample shouldn't make a difference (in expectation). This is not the case for observational studies where the ATE, ATT and ATC can be different. This is because in observational studies, the participants in the treatment group and participants in the control group can look very different from one another.
