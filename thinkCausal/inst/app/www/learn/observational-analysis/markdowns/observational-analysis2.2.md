## Choosing an Estimand

In this example, we'll be estimating the ATT. It appears that every runner under 35 wore HyperShoes. Without runners older than 35 in the control group, we don't have enough available information to infer about counter-factuals for the ATE or ATC  but we do have complete overlap for the ATT and we have enough information to infer about what would have happened if those participants had not worn HyperShoes! 

In randomized studies the ATE, ATT and ATC are expected to be the same because there are no systematic differences between the treatment and control groups. This is not the case for observational studies where the ATE, ATT and ATC can be different. This is because in observational studies, the participants in the treatment group and participants in the control group can look very different from one another.
