### Suspending disbelief to understand the goal: linear scenario

Before we begin analyzing our observational data, let's suspend belief and see what our results would look like if we had access to each runner's factual and counterfactual outcomes. With all potential outcomes, we can calculate each runner's true individual causal effect (ICE). In this plot we also can see that age is linearly related to running times.  Each runner's ICE is shown as a black line. Keep in mind that because we are interested in the ATT, we only need to predict the counterfactuals of runners in the treatment group!

Unfortunately, in practice we never have access to all potential outcomes and can never make this calculation. But in order to understand the properties of our estimators we need to be able to understand how they will perform in circumstances where we know the truth and the assumptions are satisfied. When we suspend disbelief and have access to all potential outcomes, we can calculate the true ATT of our sample by taking the average of all the individual causal effects for runners who received the treatment (wore HyperShoes) in the real world.
