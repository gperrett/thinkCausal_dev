## Suspending beleif: access to all potential outcomes

Before we begin analyzing our observational data, let's suspend our beleif and see what our results would look like if we had access to each runners factual and counter-factual outcomes. Because we are interested in the ATT, we are only need the counterfactuals of runners in the treatment group. 

We can see that age is linearly related to running times and can see what would happen to each runner when they wore HyperShoes and when they wore standard shoes. With all potential outcomes, we can calculate each runners true individual causal effect (ICE). Unfortunately, in practice we never have access to all potential outcomes and can never make this calculation.
