## Suspending beleif

Before we begin analyzing our observational data, let's suspend belief and see what our results would look like if we had access to each runners factual and counter-factual outcomes. With all potential outcomes, we can calculate each runners true individual causal effect (ICE). Each runners ICE is shown as a black line. Unfortunately, in practice we never have access to all potential outcomes and can never make this calculation. We also can see that age is linearly related to running times.

Keep in mind that because we are interested in the ATT, we are only need the counter-factuals of runners in the treatment group!
