## Suspending beleif: calculating the true ATT

Now we can calculate the true ATT for our sample of non-linear data by taking the average of all the individual causal effects for runners who received the treatment (wore HyperShoes) in the real worldand see that, on average, runners that wore HyperShoes ran 7.9 minutes faster than they would have run had they worn standard shoes. 

Remember that in practice, we will never actually know the true ATT!

Now we will return to reality where we only have access to our observed data and need to estimate the ATT.
