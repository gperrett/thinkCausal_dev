### Difference in means

If we use the difference in means as our statistical model, our estimate would be -12.6 which is  extremely far from true ATT! The story is the same as the last time we used comparing the difference in means to estimate the ATT, we are still not incorporating any information about age and the imbalance of age has not been accounted for. Not appropriately adjusting for the confounding variable of `age` explains why the estimated ATT is so biased.
