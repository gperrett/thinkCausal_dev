## Difference in means

The difference in means estimate of -12.6 is far off from the true ATT of -7.9. The problems of the difference in means model are the same with non-linear data. There is still imbalance in `age` between the treatment and control groups and without adjusting for this imbalance we will have a biased estimate of the the true ATT.
