#### Runner 2 did not wear hyperShoes.
For runner 2:
The time without hyperShoes (`Y0`) is the factual outcome. 
<br>
<br>
What the time would have been with hyperShoes (`Y1`) is the counter-factual outcome. 
<br>
<br>
To know the causal effect of hyperShoes for Runner 2, we need take the difference between `Y1` and `Y0`. 
<br>
<br>
The problem is we don't know what runner 2's time would have been if they had worn hyperShoes.
