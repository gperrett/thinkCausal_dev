We'll start by filling-in the missing `Y0` values for the runners who have 0 prior races.
<br>
<br>
We are missing `Y0` values for the 3 runners that wore hyperShoes (colored red). 
<br>
<br>
We can only see the `Y0` values for the 4 runners that did not wear hyperShoes (colored in blue). 
<br>
<br>
To fill in the 3 missing `Y0` values, we can use what we know about the 4 `Y0` values we can observe. 
<br>
<br>
How can we turn the information from the 4 `Y0` values we know into predictions for the 3 `Y0` values we don't know?
