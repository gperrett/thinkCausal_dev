We'll start by filling-in the missing `Y0` values for the runners who have 0 prior races.
<br>
<br>
We are missing 3 `Y0` values (runner 4, runner 8 and runner 9).  
<br>
<br>
But we do know the `Y0` values for runner 6, runner 13, runner 15 and runner 16.
<br>
<br>
To fill in the 3 missing `Y0` values, we can use what we know about the 4 `Y0` values we can observe. 
<br>
<br>
What is the best way to turn the 4 `Y0` values we know into predictions for the 3 `Y0` values we don't know?
