### Observed Running Data

Looking at the collected data, for each of the 20 runners we are missing data for either `Y1` (what the runners time would have been if they had worn hyperShoes) or `Y0` (what the runners time would have been if they had not worn hyperShoes). The observed running time `Y` is just which potential outcome actually happened!
