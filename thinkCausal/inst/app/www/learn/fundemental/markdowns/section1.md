### Observed Running Data
For each runner, we have collected data on whether they wore hyperShoes or did not wear hyperShoes, their race time `Y` and how many prior races they have participated in. 
<br>
<br>
The fundamental problem of causal inference is we are missing data for either `Y1` (what the runners time would have been if they had worn hyperShoes) or `Y0` (what the runners time would have been if they had not worn hyperShoes). 
<br>
<br>
The observed running time `Y` is just which potential outcome actually happened!
<br>
<br>
In this example, there are two potential outcomes:

`Y1` What would have happened with hyperShoes?
`Y0` What would have happened without hyperShoes? 

The potential outcome we observe is called the factual outcome and the potential outcome we do not observe is the counter-factual outcome.

Let's consider a few specific runners.
