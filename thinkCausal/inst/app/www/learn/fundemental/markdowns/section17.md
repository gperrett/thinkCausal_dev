### Estimating Causal Effects:
**Individual Treatment Effects**

Now that each runner has a value for `Y1` and `Y0` we can estimate the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) by taking the difference between `Y1` and `Y0` for each runner. 
<br>
<br>
We'll consider runner 1, to *estimate* the causal effect of hyperShoes for runner 1 we take the difference between what runner 1's running time was when they wore HyperShoes (`Y1` = 224) and our prediction for what  runner 1's time would have been if they had not worn hyperShoe (`Y0` = 250). 
<br>
<br>
$\text{runner 1 estimated ITE} = 224 - 250 = -26$
<br>
<br>
Repeating this for all 20 runners gives us an estimate ITE for each runner!
