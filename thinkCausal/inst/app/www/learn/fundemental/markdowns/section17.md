### Estimating Causal Effects:
**Individual Treatment Effects**

Now that each runner has a value for `Y1` and `Y0` we can estimate the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) by taking the difference between `Y1` and `Y0` for each runner. 
<br>
<br>
Consider runner 1: to *estimate* the causal effect of hyperShoes for runner 1 we take the difference between what runner 1's running time was when they wore HyperShoes (`Y1` = 224) and our prediction for what  runner 1's time would have been if they had not worn hyperShoe (`Y0` = 250). 
<br>
<br>
$\text{runner 1 estimated ITE} = 224 - 250 = -26$
<br>
<br>
Repeating this for all 20 runners gives us an estimate ITE for each runner!

Individual causal effects are confusing! If you'd like to know more you can learn more about the definition of causal effects in the potential outcomes module!
