### Addressing the problem
The fundamental problem of causal inference is a missing data problem. We will always be missing the counter-factual outcomes. How can we proceed if we will always be missing half of the data we need?

<br>
To move forward with causal inference we will need to fill in the missing counter-factual outcomes.

<br>
We'll do this by using the potential outcomes we can observe to predict what would have happened if a runner had received the opposite treatment assignment.
