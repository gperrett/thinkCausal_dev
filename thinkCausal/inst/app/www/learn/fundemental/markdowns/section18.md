### Estimating Causal Effects:
**Average Treatment Effect**

Now that we have filled in (imputed) all of our missing counter-factual outcomes we can *estimate* the average treatment effect.
<br>
<br>
**In this sample of runners the estimated average treatment effect of hyperShoes is -12.2.**
<br>
<br>
We can estimate the average treatment effect by taking the average of all 20 of the estimated individual treatment effects (ITE) or by taking the difference between the average of all 20 `Y1` values (256.4) and the average of all 20 `Y0` values (268.55). 
<br>
<br>
Both give us the same result! For all of details about average treatment effects check out the causal estimands module!
<br>
<br>
-12.2 is only an estimate of the true ATE. **How do we know if this estimate is actually close to the true ATE?**
