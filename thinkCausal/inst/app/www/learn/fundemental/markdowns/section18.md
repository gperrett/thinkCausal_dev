### Estimating Causal Effects:
**Average Treatment Effect**

Now that we have filled in (imputed) all of our missing counter-factual outcomes we can *estimate* the average treatment effect by taking the average of the 20 *estimated* ITEs.
<br>
<br>
Taking the average of the *estimated* ITEs gives us an average treatment effect of -12.15. 
<br>
<br>
You can also *estimate* the average treatment effect by taking the difference of the average of all 20 `Y1` values (256.4) and the average of all 20 `Y0` values (268.55).  If you'd like to learn more about the specifics of average treatment effects check out the causal estimands module!

Using our predictions of the missing counter-factual outcomes we can conclude that  wearing hyperShoes caused the 20 runners in our sample to run an average of 12.15 minutes faster than they would have ran had they not worn hyperShoes!

This would be really important to know if you were considering buying a pair of hyperShoes for yourself!
