Collecting more data may seem to be a simple solution. If we are missing counter-factual outcomes for each of our 20 runners, why not just have each runner re-run the race with the opposite treatment assignment. Suppose we schedule a follow-up race a week after the original race.

In this follow-up race, runners that originally wore hyperShoes will not wear hyperShoes and runners that did not wear hyperShoes will wear hyperShoes.

<br>
The problem with this is that many things will be different in the follow-up race. After the initial 26 mile race, the runners will be tiered and likely not fully recovered a week later. How will we know if the difference between times is due to the hyperShoe or not being fully recovered? 

To avoid the issue of fatigue, we could hold the follow-up race 6 months after the original race but by doing this we have introduced other factors that could explain differences in running times. Holding the follow-up race 6 months later means the weather during the race will be considerably different than the original race. It is also possible that the runners may have changes how they train since the original race. Each runner will also be 6 months older. These factors along with a nearly infinite amount of other variable will be different between the two races.

Another problem with is approach is that it requiters that we are able to convince each of our 20 runners to come back an run another race. In practice, such follow-up is extremely difficult and we are likely to lose track of many runners along the way.

Collecting more data does not seem like a good solution to the fundamental problem of causal inference, how can we proceed?
