### 1 prior race
We will apply the same statagy as before but now we will move on to filling in counter-factual outcomes from runners with 1 prior race.

**Filling in Y0**
We can fill in the missing `Y0` value for runner 7 by taking the average `Y0` value of runner 2 and runner 3. 

$$\frac{(281 + 279)}{2} = 280$$

**Filling in Y1**
To fill in the missing Y1 values for runner 2 and runner 3 we will use the average `Y1` value of runner 1. 

$$\frac{(273)}{1} = 273$$
