### Taking the mean

The best predictions come from taking averages. 
<br>
<br>
To make predictions for our missing `Y0` values we can take the average `Y0`, of the 4 runners with 0 prior races and use that average to predict what `Y0` would have been for the 3 runners with missing data. 
<br>
<br>
The average of the 4 `Y0` values we can observe is 281: 

$$\frac{(283 + 278 + 280 + 284)}{4} = 281$$
<br>
<br>
Remember we are only taking the average of the `Y0` values (shown in blue). We are ignoring the 3 red points because those are `Y1` values. For now we are only interested in filling in the missing values for `Y0`. We will return the `Y1` values later on.
