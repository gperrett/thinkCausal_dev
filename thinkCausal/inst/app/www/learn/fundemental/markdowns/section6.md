### Taking the mean
The best predictions come from taking averages. 
<br>
<br>
We can take the average `Y0` of the 4 runners with 0 prior races and use that average to predict what `Y0` would have been for the 3 runners with 0 prior races with missing `Y0` values. 
<br>
<br>
Taking the average of the 4 `Y0` values we can observe gives us 281: 

$$\frac{(284 + 283 + 280 + 278)}{4} = 281$$
