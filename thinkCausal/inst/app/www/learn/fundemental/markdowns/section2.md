#### Runner 1 wore hyperShoes.
For runner 1:
The running time with hyperShoes (`Y1`) is the factual outcome. 
<br>
<br>
What the running time would have been without hyperShoes (`Y0`) is the counter-factual outcome. 
<br>
<br>
To know the causal effect of hyperShoes for Runner 1, we need take the difference between `Y1` and `Y0`. 
<br>
<br>
The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we don't know what runner 1's time would have been if they had not worn hyperShoes.
