A new high performance running shoe that has been introduced with the claim that wearing hyperShoes causes runners to faster than they would have run without wearing hyperShoes. 

Let's imagine a sinlge runner Sal. For Sal,the causal effect of wearing hyperShoes on running time is the difference between Sal's running time if they had worn hyperShoes (`Y1`) and Sal's running time if they had not worn hyperShoes (`Y0`). Sal's running time with hyperShoes (`Y1`) and Sal's running time without hyperShoes (`Y0`) are potential outcomes that depend on whether or not Sal wears hyperShoes. 

The only problem with this is that Sal can not wear both Shoes at once! Sal **either** wore or did not wear hyperShoes. This is the fundamental problem of causal inference: a causal effect is the difference between potential outcomes but we can only observe a single potential outcome for  a given individual.

The fundamental problem of causal inference does not only apply to Sal. Suppose we have a sample of 20 runners from a recent marathon. We'll use this sample to explore how we can proceed with causal inference despite the fundamental problem of causal inference.
