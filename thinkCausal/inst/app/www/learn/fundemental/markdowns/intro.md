We have defined a causal effect as the differences between an individuals potential outcomes. This is a problem because we can only observe a single potential outcome for a given individual. This is the fundamental problem of causal inference: a causal effect is the difference between potential outcomes but we can never observe more than one potential outcome. 

Let's consider the case of the hyperShoe, a new high performance running shoe that has been introduced with the claim that wearing hyperShoes causes runners to faster than they would have run without wearing hyperShoes. 

For a single runner, Sal, the causal effect of hyperShoes is the difference between Sal's running time if they had worn hyperShoes (`Y1`) and Sal's running time if they had not worn hyperShoes (`Y0`). Sal's running time with hyperShoes (`Y1`) and Sal's running time without hyperShoes (`Y0`) are potential outcomes that depend on whether or not Sal wears hyperShoes. 

The fundamental problem of causal inference does not just exist for Sal but for every individual in a sample of runners. Suppose we have a sample of 20 runners from a recent marathon. For each runner, we have collected data on whether they wore hyperShoes or did not wear hyperShoes, their race time `Y` and how many prior races they have participated in.
