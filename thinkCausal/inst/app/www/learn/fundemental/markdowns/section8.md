Now we will consider the missing `Y1` values for the runners who have 0 prior races.
<br>
<br>
For `Y1` we have the opposite problem, we can observe `Y1` values for the three runners that wore hyperShoes (colored in red) and are missing `Y1` values for the 4 runners that did not wear hyperShoes colored in blue. 
<br>
<br>
We'll use the same approach as before were we use the average of the `Y1` values we can observe to predict what the 4 missing `Y1` values would have been.
