Now we will consider the missing `Y1` values for the runners who have 0 prior races.
<br>
<br>
For `Y1` we have the opposite problem:
<br>
We can observe the `Y1` values for runner 4, runner 8 and runner 9.
<br>
<br>
We are missing `Y1` values for runner 6, runner 13, runner 15 and runner 16.
<br>
<br>
We'll use the same approach as before, this time we will use the average of the 3 `Y1` values we can observe to predict what the 4 missing `Y1` values would have been.
