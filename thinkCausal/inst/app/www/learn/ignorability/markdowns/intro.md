Observational studies, where the treatment is not randomly assigned, make a strong **ignorability assumption**. For observational studies, the ignorability assumption is that we have measured all confounders and account for every confounder when estimating a causal effect. If this assumption is not satisfied and there are confounders not included in the analysis the result will be biased. 

To understand the ignorability assumption for observational studies and the role of confounders we will use our running hyperShoe example:

Imagine that the company that makes hyperShoes released a new study that found wearing hyperShoes causes a runner to run a marathon an average of 51.76 minutes faster than that runner would have ran without wearing hyperShoes! 

The study compared the marathon times of runners that wore hyperShoes against the marathon times of runners that did not wear hyperShoes. In the study, 300 runners wore hyperShoes and 700 runners  did not wear hyperShoes. An Average Treatment Effect(ATE) of -51.76 minutes seems like an unbelievably large effect for simply changing shoes. We'll investigate to see if we should really believe that a pair of hyperShoes would cause us to run over 50 minutes faster!
