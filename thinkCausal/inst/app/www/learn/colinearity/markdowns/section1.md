### The Study

This hyperShoe study is an *observational study* on 500 professional runners from a recent race. This race required that every runner complete to two separate qualifying races (`qualify1` and `qualify2`). 

hyperShoes are a new product and both qualifying races took place before hyperShoes were available to any runners. **This means both qualifying races must be pre-treatment variables**. We'll talk about pre-treatment vs post-treatment variable later, for now all you need to know is that **adjusting for post-treatment variables is a bad idea**.
