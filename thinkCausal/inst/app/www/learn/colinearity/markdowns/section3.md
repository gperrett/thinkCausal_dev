Every choice about including or not including covariates should be made based on whether or not it will be helpful or harmful to our estimate of the causal effect of hyperShoes on running times.

The problem is that we without knowing the true causal effect of hyperShoes on running times we can't see whether or not including a covariate is helpful or harmful.

Because this is a hypothetical study, we have the power to see the true causal effect of hyperShoes on running times. 

You can flip back and forth between our view of the data as Researchers (what we can see in real causal inference problems) and what we could see if we were an oracle with the power or seeing all potential outcomes.
