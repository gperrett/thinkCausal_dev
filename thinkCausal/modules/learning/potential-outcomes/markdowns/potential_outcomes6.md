# Potential Outcomes Notation
Using notation is a helpful way to formalize potential outcomes. This helps when we want to start thinking about functions of potential outcomes or talk about general properties that involve potential outcomes. In causal inference, the letter z can be used to represent a treatment, intervention or exposure variable. Generally, z = 1 denotes receiving the treatment, intervention or exposure in question and z = 0 denotes not receiving the treatment, intervention or exposure. Similarly, y1 reflects the outcome of interest if the treatment is received and y0 reflects the outcome of interest if the treatment was not received. y denotes the observed outcome. This is the outcome we observe in practice. It can be helpful to keep in mind that this outcome depends on an individual's value of z.

In our example, zi = 1 would denote that runner i actually wore HyperShoes and zi = 0 would denote that  runner i wore standard shoes. Now yi1 reflects what each runner's time would have been had they worn HyperShoes and yi0 reflects what each time would have been had they worn standard shoes. Note that y0 and y1 do not depend on z. That is, we can conceptualize that both exist, however only one is revealed depending on the treatment that is actually received. Lastly, y represents which value is actually observed, y is fully dependent on z. If z = 1, then y = y1 but if z = 0, then y = y0.
