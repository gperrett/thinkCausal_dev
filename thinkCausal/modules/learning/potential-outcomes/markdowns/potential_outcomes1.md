A new high performance running shoe called the HyperShoe is released with the claim that wearing the shoe causes faster marathon running times. There are conflicting reviews of the HyperShoe. Some suggest the shoes really do make marathon times faster and others think the claim is just a marketing tactic and is not actually true. Maybe more competitive runners are the ones mostly likely to invest in a pair of these shoes. How can we know whether or not the HyperShoes actually cause faster marathon times?

Consider Alex, an amateur runner who is training for an upcoming marathon race. Alex can either use the HyperShoe or a pair of normal running shoes for the race. You can decide whether or not Alex will use the HyperShoe!
