Potential outcomes tables are useful to record data for each runner in the study. Potential outcomes tables show each individual's treatment assignment, what their outcome would have been without the treatment, and what their outcome would have been with the treatment and the outcome was actually observed. Full potential outcomes tables require access to our potential outcomes time machine, you can use the buttons below to switch back and forth between what we can see with our potential outcomes time machine and what we can see in practice. <span style="color:red">From now on we will refer to this as Omniscience mode.</span>
