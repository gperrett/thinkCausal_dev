Now we get to see the run time for Alex with the Hypershoe.  It is 3:45:21.  Now we know that the Hypershoe did indeed have a causal effect on Alex's run time.


### Causal inference makes comparisons between counterfactual states for the same person.
Causal inference requires within-person comparisons between a factual outcome (what did happen) and one or more counterfactual outcomes (what would have happened under a different treatment regime). To know whether or not the shoes caused a faster marathon time compare the factual and counterfactual outcomes, we see that wearing the HyperShoes caused Alex to finish 15 minutes faster than Alex would have finished without wearing HyperShoes.
