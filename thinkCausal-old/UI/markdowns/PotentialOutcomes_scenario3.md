# Potential Outcomes - 3

<p>In this example Tau is 5 for students that don't participate in post-school program (post-school program = 0), 
  and Tau is 10 for students that participate in post-school program (post-school program = 1).</p>

<p>The true sample average treatment effect (SATE)  =  7. However, the difference in means, 88.2 - 68.4 = 19.8, cannot recover the true SATE, because the groups whose outcomes we compare differ in their pre-treatment characteristics.</p>

<p>Only those students who donâ€™t participate in the postschool program select into the treatment, and their pre-treatment scores are higher than students who participate in the post-school program.</p>
