thinkCausal is federally funded project devoted to building scaffolded causal inference software implementing Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. You can find a live, beta version [here](https://apsta.shinyapps.io/thinkCausal/).

See also the R packages [`bartCause`](https://github.com/vdorie/bartCause) and [`plotBart`](https://github.com/joemarlo/plotBart) for much of the underlying causal inference functionality.

thinkCausal is managed by [NYU PRIISM](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/priism) and is open to contributions. If you'd like to contribute to this project, please see the [contribution guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
